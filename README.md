## Introduction

Stock market analysis is essential for investors to make informed decisions when buying or selling stocks. This Python script leverages web scraping techniques to collect stock-related data, including historical prices, market trends, and other financial metrics. The script is designed to be user-friendly, allowing both beginners and experienced users to analyze stock data efficiently.

## Installation

To run this stock market analysis tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-market-analysis.git
cd stock-market-analysis
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Before running the script, ensure that you have activated your virtual environment (if you created one) by using the command mentioned in the Installation section.

To analyze a specific stock, open the terminal (command prompt) and execute the following command:

```
python stock_analysis.py
```

The script will prompt you to enter the stock symbol or ticker you want to analyze. It will then scrape the web for relevant data and present the analysis in a structured format.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries. These dependencies will be automatically installed during the installation process:

- BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and XML documents during web scraping.
- Requests: For making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For generating visualizations.

## How it Works

The stock market analysis tool uses web scraping to gather information from financial websites such as Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or other trusted sources. It fetches data related to the specified stock symbol, including historical price data, dividend yields, market trends, and more. After collecting the data, the script processes and analyzes it using Pandas and generates visualizations using Matplotlib.

The tool's modular design allows for easy extensibility and customization. You can modify the web scraping logic or add new features to suit your specific needs.
